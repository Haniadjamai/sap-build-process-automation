### About Excel SDK

The Excel SDK is a collection of activities allowing you to create automations using Microsoft Excel. It comes with a rich set of functionalities such as:

- Create new Excel Workbook
- Create new Excel Worksheet
- Read and write data from an Excel sheet, for a given data range
- Apply Filter on a column
- etc

To design your automation, you will need an Excel file filled with the sales orders data. You have the possibility to create it yourself using the below sample data:

| Order Number| Order Amount | Order Date | Shipping Country         | Expected Delivery Date | Order Status
|  :----------| :------------|:-----------| :------------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------
|  PO7991     | 410418.22    | 1/21/2022	| United States of America | 1/29/2022	            | In Time

You can also use an Excel sample of your choice.


### Use Excel Link in your Excel automations


1.  From the SAP Build Process Automation Lobby, create a new automation.
2.  Provide an appropriate name to your project and relevant automations.
3.  Select your active desktop agent version to be used during design and development of your automation.
4.  By default Excel and Core SDK are added to the automations and your automation opens in a new browser tab. You have a couple of ways to read Excel Data:
      - Using the activity **Excel Cloud Link** to achieve Excel Data Mapping.
      - Traditional step by step approach to read / write Excel data.

      In this tutorial, you will explore both ways.

    >**What is Excel Data Mapping?**

    > Excel Data Mapping allows you to transform columns-based data from an Excel sheet into datatype that can be used in your automation. The data from the Excel sheet stays the same but the structure becomes a data type structure, making it possible to use throughout your project.

5.  As a first step, locate and add **Open Excel Instance** activity to the automation flow.
    <!-- border -->![Add Open Excel Instance](01-AddOpenExcelInstance.png)

6.  Similarly locate and add **Excel Cloud Link** from the activity pane.
    <!-- border -->![Add Excel Cloud Link](02-AddExcelCloudLink.png)

7.  Now edit the properties of **Excel Cloud Link** activity. In the flow chart, select the **Excel Cloud Link** activity, on the right side menu, choose **Edit Activity** button.
    <!-- border -->![Edit Excel Cloud Activity](03-ExcelLinkEditActivity.png)

8.  Within the edit activity screen, you can either use the file picker or drag and drop your test Excel.
    <!-- border -->![Import Excel](04-ExcelCloudLink_AddExcel.png)

9.  As you can see, with the Excel cloud link capabilities, it already pre-selects the first sheet, it groups data by column names, it also finds out in few seconds the complete range of the Excel.
    <!-- border -->![Browse the data](05-ExcelData.png)

10. While Excel cloud link is great in processing the data, it still needs for runtime reference, the path of your Excel. Typically, you need the full path of the Excel. i.e. `folder path + file name`. Please provide your full path location into the path field.
    <!-- border -->![Provide Excel path](06-ExcelCloudLink_pasteExcelPath.png)

11. SAP Build Process Automation has data type functionality to logically group and process your data. You can create a data type out of the added Excel by using the Excel data structure (2).
    <!-- border -->![Create Data type out of Excel](07-ExcelCloudLink_AddExcel.png)

12. Provide a data type name. As you can see **Excel Cloud Link** already identifies field names using the first row of each column in your Excel and determines the field type based on the type of data present in each column below the first row.
    <!-- border -->![Provide Data type](08-ExcelCloudLink_DataType.png)

13. **Excel Cloud Link** is a helper function to read a given range of data in your Excel. This will be returned through the **Output Parameter**. If you wish, you may edit the output parameter name on the right side.
    <!-- border -->![Edit Output Parameter](09-EditOutputParameter.png)

14. Now you see the benefit of using Excel cloud link by printing output parameters. For this you will use a loop activity **For Each**.  
    <!-- border -->![Add For Each](10-AddForEach.png)

15. As a loop variable, you can add the **Output Parameter** from **Excel Cloud Link** activity.
    <!-- border -->![Add Loop Variable](11-AddLoopVariable.png)

16. Now you can print the customer name by adding a **Log Message**. If you are using the sample data provided in this tutorial you can print **Order Number**.
    <!-- border -->![Add Log Message](12-AddLogMessage.png)

17. Initially you add **Customer.name**.
    <!-- border -->![Add Customer Name](13-AddCustomerName.png)

18. At first it takes 0-th index. You use **index** variable, so for each loop iteration, it can print the corresponding value.
    <!-- border -->![Add Loop Index to the string](14-AddIndex.png)

19. Add **Close Excel Instance** as you added **Open Excel Instance** in the first step.
    <!-- border -->![Add Close Excel Instance](14-1-AddCloseExcelInstance.png)

20. Now you can test the output after saving the project.
    <!-- border -->![Save and Run project to validate result](15-Output.png)

In the next step, you will take a more traditional approach to process the Excel data.



### Process Excel data


1. Lets start by adding a new automation to the project and add **Open Excel Instance** to the flow.
  <!-- border -->![Add Open Excel Instance](16-AddOpenExcelInstance.png)

2. You create a couple of string variables to create base folder and file name. Search for **String** and add it to the flow.
  <!-- border -->![Create String Variables FolderPath & FileName](17-CreateStringVariable.png)

3. One of the variable will point to the base `folder path` and the second variable will point to the `file name`. Creating them in this form, helps to use them in subsequent activity types.
  <!-- border -->![Create String Variables FolderPath & FileName](18-Created2VariableNames.png)
  <!-- border -->![Create String Variables FolderPath & FileName](18-Created2VariableNames2.png)

4. You add **Open Workbook** activity and point it to the full path `FolderPath` of the test Excel file. This will open the specific Excel file.
  <!-- border -->![Add Open Workbook](20-AddOpenWorkbook.png)
  <!-- border -->![Add Open Workbook](20-AddOpenWorkbook2.png)

5. To activate the workbook and the first worksheet:
   
    -  In the Automation Details search for the activity **Activate Workbook** and **Activate Worksheet**.
    -  Drag and drop the activity into the canvas.
  <!-- border -->![Activate Worksheet](21-ActivateWorkbookWorksheet.png) 

    -  Input for the activate work book activity is the file name.
    -  The input of the activate worksheet activity is the first sheet name.
  <!-- border -->![Activate Worksheet](21-ActivateWorkbookWorksheet2.png)
  <!-- border -->![Activate Worksheet](21-ActivateWorkbookWorksheet4.png)

    > You can use variables or hard coded values for now. If you are trying a different Excel, use these values appropriately.
 
6. Now that Excel sheet is open, you can apply filters, hide columns or get values from a range of cells or add a new sheet and copy a range of values to the newly created sheet.

7.  Now Add **Filter Range** activity. 
  <!-- border -->![Add Filter Range](24-FilterColumn.png)

    In the **Filter Range**, you specify the data range, where the filter needs to be applied, along with the column on which the filter needs to apply with a filter condition. 
   <!-- border -->![Add Filter Range](24-FilterColumn2.png)
    > You add a new Excel sheet to your workbook and copy this filtered data onto that, just for demonstration purpose.

8. Subsequently you can add **Hide column** activity to hide a specific column in the result.
    <!-- border -->![Add Hide Column](25-AddHideColumns.png)
    <!-- border -->![Add Hide Column](25-AddHideColumns2.png)

9. You copy the result of filter to a new sheet. For this you add a sheet through **Add Worksheet**  and give it a name **Result**.
    <!-- border -->![Add a New Worksheet](26-AddAddWorksheet.png)

10. Add **Activate Worksheet** to activate the new worksheet, in the WorksheetName box put the name of your first sheet of your original excel file.
    <!-- border -->![Activate original sheet](27-ActivateBackFirstSheet.png)

11. Add **Copy Range** activity and provide the source range, destination worksheet and workbook and starting cell for copy.
    <!-- border -->![Add Copy Range](28-AddCopyRange.png)

12. Now add **Save As Workbook** to save the new sheet as another file. You have the option to save workbook as an Excel file or CSV file. In order to save as a new CSV file, you will need a file path to store this CSV file. This will be of the format `folderName` + `fileName` without extension where it needs to be saved.
    <!-- border -->![Save As Workbook](30-SaveAsWorkbook.png)

13. Finally, you need to include **Close Excel Instance** to conclude the step.
    <!-- border -->![Add Close Instance](31-AddCloseExcelInstance.png)

14. You can save the project and test it to validate the result.
    <!-- border -->![Run the project to test and validate](32-ValidationResult.png)

15. At the end, when this tutorial will be tested, for example the below source data will be used:
    <!-- border -->![Source Excel Data](33-OriginalExcelData.png)

16. After the automaton is executed, it has filtered the data, hidden a column (Column C) and resultant Excel will look like this.
