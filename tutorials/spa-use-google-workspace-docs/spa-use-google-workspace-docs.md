    - Select the activity. Under **Input Parameters**, for `documentId`, choose the pencil to open the expression editor.

    - Choose as **Variables**: `createdDocument`>`documentId`.

    - Choose **Save Expression**.

    > # What is going on?
    > Google Documents can be updated with other activities using the document Id. By entering the Id of the document you would indicate the automation in which document it has to insert text in.

5. For `textToInsert` parameter, enter the following text: **Hello from SAP Build Process Automation. Today you will learn how to use Google docs**. Please select the expression in quotes and hit enter.

### Retrieve the Google document

You will add an activity in the automation to retrieve a Google Docs document from your Google Drive that was created in the above steps:

- In the **Automation Details** panel, under **Tools**, search for the **Get Document (Google Docs)** and drag and drop it into the workflow.

There are two ways to retrieve the document id of the Google Document, either through the URL of Google Document or through the **Create Document (Google Docs)** activity (step2 of the automation).

[OPTION BEGIN [`FromURL`]]

1. You can find the Document Id of the Google Document in the URL.
